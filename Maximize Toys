Given an array arr[ ] of length N consisting cost of N toys and an integer K depicting the amount with you. Your task is to find maximum number of toys you can buy with K amount. 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 7 
K = 50
arr[] = {1, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10}
Output: 4
Explaination: The costs of the toys 
you can buy are 1, 12, 5 and 10.



 int toyCount(int N, int K, vector<int> arr)
    {
        // code here
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        long  cnt=0;
        long sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
            sum+=arr[i];
            if(sum<=K){
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
