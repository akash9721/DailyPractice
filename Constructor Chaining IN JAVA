Constructor chaining is the process of calling a sequence of constructors.
We can do it in two ways: by using this() keyword for chaining constructors 
in the same class. by using super() keyword for chaining constructors from the parent class.

package com.java;
class Base{
	public Base() {
		System.out.println("this is default constructor of base");
	}
	
	Base(int a,int b){
		this();
		System.out.println("This is parameterize constructor of base");
		System.out.println("sum is: "+(a+b));
	}
}

class Derived extends Base{
	
	Derived(int a,int b){
		super(5,5);
		System.out.println("This is parameterize constructor of derived");
		System.out.println("sum is: "+(a+b));
	}
}
public class ConstructorChaining {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Derived derived=new Derived(7, 7);
	}

}
